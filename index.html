			For my project I plan on making a website around a hobby that I plan on turning into a bussiness. The front page will have some examples of pictures I have taken. I plan on advertising aerial photography for real estate. I will have a page for personal photos. A page for different packages for what a customer might want. I will have an email contact like the quiz we just took. I will have a page about my credentials and lincense for comercial aerial photgraphy.
